 * Pre-flight check. Run it after every change to the patchers, before installing.
 *
 * It answers the two questions that decide whether this extension still works:
 *
 *   1. Does everything we ship parse?  Including the injected script, which is a string inside webview.js and so is
 *      invisible to `node --check` on the file itself.
 *   2. Does every edit still match exactly once, on a pristine Claude Code bundle?  A patched file cannot answer this,
 *      so the pristine source is the untouched backup when one exists, or the file itself when it carries no marker.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node test/check.js                       find Claude Code installs and check against each
 *   node test/check.js <bundle> [<bundle>]   check against bundles named explicitly (index.js / extension.js, or a
 *                                            backup of either — useful while an older patch still owns the live files)

   The script is one closure, so calling a name nobody declares is a ReferenceError when that line runs - not a syntax
   error. `new vm.Script` accepts it, and packaging, installing and reloading all report success, so the only evidence
   is the feature quietly not working. One such name survived eleven releases: a commit that reshaped the chimes
   deleted the two accessors for the stored mute preference and left their three call sites behind. The button was
   still inserted, then threw before it could set its own tooltip, and the sweep's catch swallowed that on every pass.
   The whole visible symptom was an icon with no hover text.

   Heuristic by necessity - regex, not a parser - so it errs toward silence: it only looks at `name(` calls that are
   not property accesses, and it treats everything declared anywhere in the closure as in scope. That is weaker than
   real scope analysis and would miss a name declared in one function and called from another. It still catches the

   One equality: the builds the record claims are exactly the builds this machine just verified. Both directions matter
   and for different reasons. A build claimed but not verifiable here means the commit asserts something nothing
   established - which happened, silently, while the record carried builds forward. A build verified here but missing
   from the record means an upgrade goes unrecorded for ever, because a record that is merely conservative never fails
   anything and so nothing ever asks for it to be written again.

   It can only be checked where the bundles are, so a runner with no Claude Code gets a skip rather than a pass, and
   enforcement is local. The place it reaches whoever is working here is this suite, which is the first step of finishing
   any change rather than a separate thing to remember.

   Skipped only by `--without-version-record`, which the one command that writes the record passes when it runs this
