"""Refuse a write to the work plan that carries a description longer than the view will show.

The limit itself is explained in the skill: a description is what the next person needs in order to pick the task up,
not the story of how the task got there, and given room the story is what gets written. Until now the limit lived in two
places that both come after the fact - the skill asking for it, and the view cutting what it was given. Neither stops an
over-long description from being written, and the one that cuts it does so where the reader is, not where the writer is.

So this refuses the write. The criterion is exactly the one the view uses, which is the only way the two can agree: what
is rejected here is precisely what would have been cut there.

What it does not cover: a plan file written through Bash - a heredoc, python -c, sed. Finding a JSON payload inside a
shell command is not something that can be done reliably, and a gate that half-reads shell would refuse legitimate
commands while still missing the ones that mattered. The tools that actually write this file are Write and Edit.
