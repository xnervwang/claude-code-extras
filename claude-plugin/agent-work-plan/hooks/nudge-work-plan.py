"""Say something when a turn did real work and left the work plan untouched.

The skill says when to update the plan. This exists because a rule about noticing a state change is the kind that fails
in the moment it is needed - the same reason the injection hook exists rather than trusting the skill to be loaded.

It is deliberately hard to trigger. A reminder that fires when nothing was owed teaches the reader to skip it, and a
skipped reminder is worse than none: it costs attention on every turn and buys nothing on the turn that matters. So it
speaks only when the turn changed something, the plan is older than the turn, the turn never went to the plan at all,
AND this has not already been said about a plan in exactly this state.

"Changed something" is counted as things altered, not tool calls made. That distinction is the whole difference between
a reminder worth reading and one worth skipping: a turn spent reading, searching and measuring makes plenty of calls and
owes the plan nothing, and 18 of 29 reminders in the conversation that prompted this went to turns of exactly that kind.

That last condition is what lets the reminder be answered. Reading the plan and finding nothing owed is a complete
reconciliation, but it leaves no mark on the file - so judging by the file's age alone, a turn that had looked and a
turn that had forgotten were the same turn. The reminder then repeated on every working turn for the rest of a
conversation whose plan was already correct, and each repeat cost a round of explaining that nothing was owed. Three in
a row is what prompted this.

Where no plan exists at all it speaks once, and then never again in that conversation. This is the harder case, because
until something writes a plan the injection hook has nothing to inject and the skill is only found when its description
happens to match - so a conversation can run to its end without the facility ever being mentioned. Measured across 1835
transcripts on the machine this was written on, 4 of them had a plan. A hook staying quiet to cost nothing is how that
happens, so the cost is now one sentence, once, after a turn big enough to have needed it.

WHICH SESSIONS THIS REACHES, and why detached agents are not a cost worth engineering against.

A sub-agent started in-process shares the main session's id, and these hooks do not run for it at all: measured over
three of them in one conversation, zero injections against the main session's 330. So a sub-agent neither sees the plan
nor is reminded of it, and whatever it did has to be recorded by the session that dispatched it.

A detached agent - one started as its own process - does get the hooks, because it has a session id of its own. It
therefore has no plan file, which puts it on the branch above, and that was briefly expensive: 53 of them were offered a
plan inside half an hour. What stopped it was not a check for detached agents but the requirement that the user have
spoken several times, added three hours later. A detached agent is handed one task and nothing else, so it counts one
user turn against a threshold of three and is silent for the rest of its life. No measured offer to one has happened
since, and nothing here identifies such a session or needs to.

Which is the part worth keeping: the question "can this conversation branch" subsumes "is this a detached worker", so
there is no second mechanism to maintain. Tightening the first threshold is what to reach for if these ever turn up
again, rather than adding a way to recognise them - there is no payload field verified to distinguish one, and looking
for a signal that happens to correlate is how a check starts passing for the wrong reason.
