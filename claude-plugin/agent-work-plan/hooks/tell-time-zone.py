"""Tell the model which time zone the user reads the panel in, when that is not this machine's.

With Remote SSH the model runs on one machine and the person reads on another, often hours apart. Every clock the model
can see is this machine's - `date`, file times, logs, the date Claude Code gives as today - while the panel shows times
in the reader's zone, so a model that reports "finished at 04:30" is right by a clock the reader never sees.

It is said when the conversation has not been told yet, and again only when something has made the last telling stale
or far away (see `due`): after a compaction, which summarises it away; when the offset changes, at a daylight-saving
change or a different client; when either side's date turns over, since "today" then means two different days; and
once the context has grown well past where it was last said. The sentence is about 90 tokens, and saying it on every
message cost that much again each time for a fact that had not changed. Nothing at all is said while the two zones
agree, which keeps a window on its own machine at no cost.

The zone comes from the panel, by way of the extension (src/panel-tz.js reports it, extension.js leaves it in
ZONE_FILE). The hook has no zone database of its own - Python 3.9's zoneinfo is not there on every machine this runs
on - so it asks the C library, through TZ and the system's zone files, what the time is there.
