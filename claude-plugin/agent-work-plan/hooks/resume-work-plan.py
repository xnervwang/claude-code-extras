"""Right after a compaction, point the conversation at its work plan and say the context is now at its smallest.

The injection hook puts the plan's open rows in front of the model on every user prompt, and the turn that resumes
straight after a compaction does not pass through one - so it is the one turn that hook cannot reach, and it is the turn
that most needs the plan. This runs on SessionStart with the compact matcher, which is exactly that turn.

What the reader gets from the file that the summary does not give it is in the `detail` of the rows that are `doing`:
refresh-work-plan.py asked for the next concrete step, what not to do, and the user's own words to be written there
before the compaction. The summary covers more ground but orders it by kind, and it retells verdicts rather than stating
them.

A path and not the file's contents. Reading the file with the Read tool puts it in the recently-read set, so the client's
own restore carries it through the next compaction for free; a hook's output is not a file read and forfeits that. And
the summary has turned every tool call in the context into prose - the first real call after it is what puts the
conversation back into using tools.

Saying the context is now at its smallest is the other half. The summary carries whatever was asked before the
compaction, so a reader can pick up a request about an approaching compaction and act on it with the context nearly
empty. This is the only place that can say it has been overtaken.

It says nothing when the conversation keeps no plan - nothing before the compaction asked it for anything, so there is
nothing to overtake - and nothing when the latest reply matches quietWhenReplyMatches (see plan_path.py).
