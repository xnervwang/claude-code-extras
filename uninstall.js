/*
 * Uninstall hook (package.json "vscode:uninstall"). VS Code runs this with plain Node when it deletes the extension's
 * folder, which in remote development is when the remote server next starts - possibly hours after the uninstall. The
 * extension's own deactivate therefore restores Claude Code as soon as the editor restarts its extensions, and starts
 * this script in a process of its own for the rest (src/removal.js). So this usually runs twice, and every step in it is
 * safe to repeat: a restore finds nothing left to restore, and unregistering a plugin that is gone changes nothing.
 *
 * Without it, uninstalling this extension would leave every patched Claude Code file behind — still carrying our
 * marker, still running our script, with nothing left installed that knows how to undo it. So this restores every
 * install it can find, in every extensions folder it can think of.
 *
 * The adapter list comes from src/adapters.js, the same list the entry point uses, so a target cannot be wired into
 * one and forgotten here.
 *
 * It also unregisters the companion Claude Code plugin, because one thing was installed and one thing has to be enough
 * to uninstall. Unregistering deletes the plugin's data directory, and the work plans live in it, so they are copied to
 * ~/.claude/agent-work-plan-plans-<timestamp>/ first, with a note in there saying what they are. They are somebody's own
 * writing; uninstalling an editor extension is not a request to delete it.
 *
 * The staged copy of the plugin in this extension's global storage is left where it is: that is the editor's own space
 * to reclaim, and nothing reads it once the marketplace entry is gone.
