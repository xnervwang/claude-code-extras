/*
 * Work Plan for Claude Code — user interface additions for the Claude Code panel in VS Code.
 *
 * This extension owns no user interface of its own. It patches the Claude Code extension's own files at rest, one
 * adapter per target file (see src/adapters.js), and every write is guarded the same way: match the expected code
 * shape exactly once or write nothing, keep the untouched original beside the file, replace atomically, and put the
 * original back on Remove or uninstall. A Claude Code build whose shape does not match is reported and left alone.
 *
 * Because the patch lives in files the editor has already loaded, installing or upgrading it asks for one reload.
 * After that, turning the marks off and changing the message color take effect live, through the stylesheet written
 * next to the panel (see src/live.js).
