/*
 * The work plan: what each conversation still has to do, read from a file the conversation itself maintains.
 *
 * One file per conversation, in the data directory the platform gives the companion Claude Code plugin:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/plugins/data/agent-work-plan-claude-code-extras/<session id>.json
 *
 * That location is not a choice of ours - it is what a plugin is given, created when the plugin is installed. The two
 * nearby places are both wrong for it: ~/.claude/scratch is one person's own convention and means nothing on another
 * machine, and ~/.claude/projects is Claude Code's own namespace, where a file of ours would sooner or later collide
 * with something official.
 *
 * A session id is unique across every project on a machine, so it is the whole name and no grouping directory is needed.
 *
 * The view reads only the current conversation's file, named by the session id the host provides. It never reads the
 * whole directory, which would load every conversation on the machine into every window, at a cost that grows with how
 * many conversations have ever existed.
 *
 * Nothing here writes those files. The shape below is the whole contract between the two halves:
 *
 *   { "title": "optional name for this conversation",
 *     "nodes": [ { "title": "...", "state": "discussing|todo|doing|waiting|parked|done|dropped",
 *                  "note": "optional, read in the dialog and the hover rather than on the row",
 *                  "detail": "optional, several lines; what the row cannot say in its width",
 *                  "opened": "optional ISO 8601; when this row was added",
 *                  "since": "optional ISO 8601; when it entered the state it is in",
 *                  "closed": "optional ISO 8601; when it reached done or dropped",
 *                  "children": [ ... ] } ] }
 *
 * A child is something that has to be finished before its parent can be, whether that was planned or discovered on the
 * way. Nesting means exactly that and nothing else - not the order topics came up in.
 *
 * Reading is forgiving about a file that is absent or half-written, since it is written by another process and may be
 * caught mid-write. It is NOT forgiving quietly: a file that exists and cannot be parsed comes back as an entry with an
 * error on it, so the view can say so. A plan that silently shows nothing is indistinguishable from no work left.
